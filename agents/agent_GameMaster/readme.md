# `GameMasterAgent`

An authoritative simulator for a larger world with clustered spawning near center using a golden-angle ring. It consumes player ticks and broadcasts `world_state` at a regular cadence.

## Behavior

<details>
<summary><b>(Click to expand)</b> The agent goes through these steps:</summary>
<br>

1. Start a fixed time step simulation loop at about 60 Hz on a large map.
2. `@client.receive("gm/tick")`

   * Creates a player on first contact and places it near the center ring with small jitter.
   * Updates pressed keys for that player.
3. Simulation step

   * Applies diagonal-normalized velocity and clamps to bounds.
4. `@client.send("gm/reply")` every 50 ms

   * Publishes authoritative `world_state`.
5. `@client.hook(Direction.RECEIVE)`

   * Normalizes envelopes to a consistent dict payload.
